Tao Group Hospitality's business and liquidity have been materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and all Tao Group Hospitality venues are currently closed. \n\nThe net loss for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020 was primarily due to a non-cash impairment of intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill. The Tao Group Hospitality acquisition was completed on January 31, 2017. The remaining Tao Group Hospitality Fair Value Deficit was allocated to goodwill for a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $80,698. \n\nThe financial report discusses the non-cash impairment charge of $102.211 million associated with Tao Group Hospitality for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020, as well as the sale of equity capital in Tribeca Enterprises in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The report also notes the impact of the FASB's ASU No. 2016-02 on lease accounting and an increase in net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the prior year period. The Company's operations and operating results have been materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken in response by the government and certain professional sports leagues. \n\nDuring the nine months ended March 31, 2020, Tao Group Hospitality repaid $5 million under the Tao Subordinated Credit Agreement. The Entertainment Distribution on April 17, 2020 resulted in two segments, the Entertainment business and the Tao Group Hospitality business, which will be presented in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020. \n\nThe decrease in suite license revenues for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020 was primarily due to the impact of the temporary closure of venues since March 12, 2020 due to COVID-19. For the nine months ended March 31, 2020, the Company had higher per-event revenue from a theatrical production at the Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden and The Chicago Theatre in the current year period largely offset by the impact of a large-scale special event held at Radio City Music Hall during the prior year period. The Company\u2019s business operations have been suspended due to COVID-19.",

Additionally, the company's International Markets Group had a second quarter 2022 EBIT of $60 million, a decrease of $144 million from a year ago. The company also expects to contribute between $600 million and $700 million to its global funded pension plans in 2022.\n\nWe also have information that Ford Credit repurchased approximately $3 billion principal amount of its public unsecured debt securities in June 2022 and that the company recorded $2.6 billion of pre-tax special item charges in the second quarter of 2022. The net income attributable to Ford Motor Company in the second quarter of 2022 was $0.667 billion, and the company's adjusted EBIT was $3.722 billion.\n\nFurthermore, the estimate of future warranty and field service action costs, net of estimated supplier recoveries, for the periods ended June 30 was $0.518 billion. In the first half of 2022, there were 43 million shares excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, due to their anti-dilutive effect. The carrying value of hedged debt was $33.4 billion at June 30, 2022.\n\nBased on this information, we can fill in some of the cells in the table:\n\n|   |   |   | **First Half ** |   |<NEWLINE>|   | **2022 ** | **H / (L) ** | **2021 ** | **H / (L) ** |<NEWLINE>| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |<NEWLINE>| **Cash Flows from Operating Activities ($B) ** |   |   |   |   |<NEWLINE>| **Net Income/(Loss) ($M) ** | $667M |   |   |   |<NEWLINE>| **Net Income/(Loss) Margin (%) ** |   |   |   |   |<NEWLINE>| **Company Adj.

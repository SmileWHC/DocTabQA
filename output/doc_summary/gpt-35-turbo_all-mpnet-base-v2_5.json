The Company's Biologics net revenue decreased by $222 million, or 32%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. Goodwill impairment charges during the three months ended March 31, 2023 were associated with the Company\u2019s Consumer Health reporting unit. The Company had $546 million of unutilized capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility as of March 31, 2023. The report also includes information on the fair value measurement for financial assets and liabilities, debt and financing arrangements, amortization expense related to intangible assets, and contract assets and liabilities.\nThe Company acquired Bettera Holdings, LLC for approximately $1 billion in October 2021. The year-over-year decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $9 million decline in employee-related costs, a $4 million decrease in stock-based compensation, a $4 million decrease in non-income taxes, partially offset by $7 million in net incremental expenses from businesses acquired in the last 12 months. The net income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was a loss of $282 million, and the net revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 decreased $216 million, or 17%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. Goodwill impairment charges during the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2023 were associated with the Consumer Health reporting unit, which is part of the Pharma and Consumer Health segment. The Company drew down $715 million on its revolving credit facility to supplement operating cash flows and fund the Metrics acquisition, of which $165 million was repaid during the nine months ended March 31, 2023.",

31.6% of sales, compared to $176.7 million, or 37.7% of sales, for the same period last year, a decrease of 610 basis points.\n- The net income (loss) for the 13 weeks ended December 1, 2018 was $0 and for the 39 weeks ended December 1, 2018 was a loss of $130.0 million.\n\n- The financial report segment mentions the adoption of ASU 2018-14, a one-time cash retention award given to Nancy A., and unchanged risk factors from the previous year's Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n- The report also notes a net loss of $130.0 million for the year-to-date period of fiscal 2019, a decrease in merchandise margin, and a decrease in gross profit to $130.5 million, or 31.6% of sales, for the third quarter of fiscal 2019.\n- In addition, the report discusses the Revolving Credit Facility with a borrowing
